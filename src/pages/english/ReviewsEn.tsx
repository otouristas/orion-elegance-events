The venue was simple but extremely romantic, clean and tasteful, truly the wedding scenery was very beautiful. The food was simply excellent! The PLEIADES catering exceeded every expectation, our guests are still talking about how delicious all the dishes were. Thanos kept the dance floor full with his music until the end with great mood and dancing. Mr. Michalis at the bar deserves many congratulations as he served 260 people alone, with a smile and professionally without any delay. I also want to thank Mrs. Giota for her cooperation and contribution throughout the preparation and the evening! We thank you all from the heart for making this evening so special!"

She treated us excellently and made us feel like we were family. The maitre and waiters were very polite and very helpful. DJ Nikos Avramopoulos on music coverage and Damianos Alatzas on special effects were AMAZING and we had impeccable cooperation and everything we had in mind they made even more perfect. The estate's space was incredible. Everything harmoniously connected and made our night magical. As for the food, it was WONDERFUL, VERY TASTY and none of us had complaints. We recommend it unreservedly. Thank you all very much for everything you did for us to make this unique evening special!"
